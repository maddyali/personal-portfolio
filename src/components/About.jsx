                So I used to be an accountant. The problem? I liked when money
                went missing. Now before you get any ideas, let me explain. You
                see, it gave me a problem to solve:
              </p>

              <ul className=" list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4">
                <li>Was it human error?</li>
                <li>A spreadsheet mistake?</li>
                <li>Someone cooking the books?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                It was my introduction to the art of debugging. When I realized
                software development is just testing, problem solving, and
                building solutionsâ€“I was hooked. Now, instead of tracking down
                missing money, I track down problems to solve using code.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not building, you'll find me shooting hoops, reading
                with an iced americano in hand, or creating educational content
                online.
              </p>

                My goal? To build things people love with people that inspire
                me.
